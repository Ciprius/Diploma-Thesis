The architecture of the focus detector consists of three files as follows:

\textcolor{green}{\sout{ar prinde bine niste diagrame aici (use cases, conceptual model, class diagram, sequence diagram)}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{cnn.py} contains the architecture of the conlutional neural network and the image processing required for detecting the face and eye, in order to training the network (a more in depth look will be in the next section).
    \item \textbf{Utils.py} consists of functions that compute, plays or returns informations to the main file (also, a more elaborate explanation will be done in the next section). Contains the following functions: 
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item \textbf{sound\textunderscore alarm} takes a parameter, the path to an audio file and plays it.
            
            \item \textbf{eye\textunderscore aspect\textunderscore ratio} also takes one parameter that is used to compute eye aspect ratio.
            
            \item \textbf{get\textunderscore face\textunderscore utils} requires zero parameters and returns the landmarks of a face.
            
            \item \textbf{get\textunderscore haar\textunderscore cascades} returns the detection of the face and eye, also it require zero parameters.
        \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{main.py} contains all the computing and predictions that helps the driver to stay focused at the road. Also it has all the thresholds for any activity such as focus, drowsiness or focus prediction, all the face\&\ eye detection features in order to make the predictions (more explanations and examples are shown in the following section).
